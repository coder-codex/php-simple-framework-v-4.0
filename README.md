This repo contains the source code needed to develop the `simple` framework.

This is the 4.0 version of the `simple` framework.

Updates from  V 3.0 to V 4.0 :

<pre>

Templating is now available.

Data can now be transferred from the `view` to the `layout`.

The information gets transferred from the `view` to the `layout` thru the `render` method.

Inspect the `DefaultController` within the `backend` alias.

Inspect the `render` method.

The source code for the `render` method cand be found by accessing `vendor/framework/controllers/Controller.php`.

</pre>

Clone the repo, study the source code, investigate the flow, learn the logic behind the code.

Enjoy :)
